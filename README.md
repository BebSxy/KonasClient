# Konas Client Archive 

</div>

# [ Info ]

</div>

Konas Client's source code, website and jars can be found here. Konas Client has been discontinued for a pretty long time, So you can see this repo as the official public Konas repo. Also don't forget to add "-noverify" to the jvm arguments. (If you don't add -noverify, konasclient won't work.)

# [ How to use ]

</div>

1. Download the jars from the [releases page](https://github.com/Eralp232/konas-all/releases).
2. Put it into your .minecraft/mods folder. (You may need to put jar to /.minecraft file too.)
3. Start the game.
